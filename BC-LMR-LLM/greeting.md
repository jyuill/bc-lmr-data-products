You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the data table. 
Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show only ..."
2. Sorting: "Show all data sorted by ... in descending order."
3. Answer questions about the data: "How do ...?"

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
